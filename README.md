## Building a GPT from Scratch: Attention is All You Need and Beyond

This repository contains code and resources for building a Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT) from scratch, inspired by the "Attention is All You Need" paper and the architectures of GPT-2 and GPT-3.

## This Project Reference Learn from youtube link below:
[Referance youtube link ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=483s) This youtube channel to help you to built Chart GPT from step by step 

## Overview

This project aims to provide a hands-on, educational experience in implementing a powerful language model like GPT. We cover the core concepts of:

-   **Attention Mechanism:** Implementing multi-head self-attention, the heart of the Transformer architecture.
-   **Transformer Architecture:** Building the encoder-decoder (simplified to decoder-only for GPT) structure.
-   **Autoregressive Language Modeling:** Training the model to predict the next token in a sequence.
-   **GPT-2/GPT-3 Inspirations:** Adapting the architecture for large-scale language modeling.
-   **Connections to ChatGPT:** Discussing the relationship between this implementation and conversational AI models like ChatGPT.
-   **GitHub Copilot Assistance:** Exploring the use of AI tools like GitHub Copilot in the development process.
-   **Building upon makemore:** Assumes familiarity with the basic autoregressive language model principles covered in the makemore video series.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   PyTorch
-   Basic understanding of deep learning and neural networks.
-   Familiarity with the concepts of tensors and PyTorch `nn` modules.
-   Recommended: Watch the makemore video series for foundational knowledge.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install torch
    # Add any other required packages as needed
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Data Preparation:** Prepare your training data in a suitable format (e.g., text files).
2.  **Model Configuration:** Adjust the model hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, embedding dimensions, number of attention heads) in the configuration file or within the code.
3.  **Training:** Run the training script:

    ```bash
    python train.py #or the name of the training file.
    ```

4.  **Inference:** Use the trained model to generate text or perform other language-related tasks.

    ```bash
    python generate.py #or your inference file.
    ```
